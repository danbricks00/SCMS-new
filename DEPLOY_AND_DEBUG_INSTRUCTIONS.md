### Root Cause Options:
1. **Old deployment** - Not latest code

## 📱 Test on iPhone with Console

### Setup (One-Time):

**Requirements:**
- iPhone 16 Plus
- Mac computer
- USB cable

**Steps:**
1. Connect iPhone to Mac via USB
2. On iPhone: Settings → Safari → Advanced → "Web Inspector" = ON
3. On iPhone: Open Safari → Go to Railway/Vercel URL
4. On Mac: Safari → Develop menu appears
5. Develop → [Your iPhone 16 Plus] → [Your Page]
6. Console opens!

### What to Look For:

**When you open Teacher Portal:**
```javascript
// Should see immediately:
Detecting web device: {
  userAgent: "Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 18_0...",
  platform: "iPhone",
  maxTouchPoints: 5,
  screenWidth: 430,
  hasTouch: true
}
```

**Then should see:**
```javascript
✅ Mobile device detected via user agent
```

**If you see this instead:**
```javascript
❌ Desktop device detected
```
**→ Take screenshot and share!**
