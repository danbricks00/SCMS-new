## üéØ Vercel Pro - Debugging Tools

Since you have **Vercel Pro**, you get access to:
- ‚úÖ Real-time logs
- ‚úÖ Runtime logs (console output)
- ‚úÖ Error tracking
- ‚úÖ Performance monitoring
- ‚úÖ Preview deployments
- ‚úÖ Analytics

Let's use these to debug!

## üìä Check Vercel Deployment Logs

### Step 1: Verify Latest Deployment

1. Go to https://vercel.com/dashboard
2. Select your SCMS project
3. Click "**Deployments**" tab
4. Check latest deployment:
   - Status: ‚úÖ Ready
   - Commit: `d4efdab` (should match latest)
   - Time: Within last few minutes

### Step 2: Check Build Logs

1. Click on latest deployment
2. Scroll to "**Build Logs**" section
3. Should see:
   ```
   ‚úì Bundled successfully
   ‚úì Exported: dist
   ‚úì 14 static routes generated
   ```

### Step 3: Check Runtime Logs

**With Vercel Pro, you get runtime logs!**

1. Deployment page ‚Üí "**Runtime Logs**" tab
2. Filter by: Last 1 hour
3. Look for your console.log() output
4. Should see device detection logs

**Note:** Runtime logs may not show client-side console logs. For that, we need browser console.

## üì± Debug on iPhone via Mac

### Setup Web Inspector:

**One-Time Setup:**
1. **On iPhone:**
   - Settings ‚Üí Safari ‚Üí Advanced
   - Enable "**Web Inspector**"

2. **On Mac:**
   - Safari ‚Üí Preferences ‚Üí Advanced
   - Check "**Show Develop menu in menu bar**"

### View Console Logs:

**Every Time You Debug:**
1. Connect iPhone 16 Plus to Mac via USB
2. On iPhone: Open Safari ‚Üí Go to Vercel URL
3. On Mac: Safari ‚Üí **Develop** ‚Üí [Your iPhone 16 Plus] ‚Üí [Page Name]
4. Console window opens showing iPhone logs!

### What to Look For:

```javascript
// Should appear immediately when opening Teacher Portal scanner:

Detecting web device: {
  userAgent: "Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 18_0 like Mac OS X) AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) Version/18.0 Mobile/15E148 Safari/604.1",
  platform: "iPhone",
  maxTouchPoints: 5,
  screenWidth: 430,
  hasTouch: true
}

// Then should show:
‚úÖ Mobile device detected via user agent

// Then should show:
=== CAMERA PERMISSION REQUEST START ===
Timestamp: 2025-10-12T22:45:00.000Z
Platform: web
Is Mobile Device: true    ‚Üê MUST BE TRUE
Is Desktop Web: false     ‚Üê MUST BE FALSE
```

---

## üêõ Diagnosis Based on Console Output

### Scenario 1: `isMobile: false` (Most Likely)

**Console shows:**
```javascript
‚ùå Desktop device detected
Is Mobile Device: false
Is Desktop Web: true
```

**Root Cause:** Detection logic not finding iPhone pattern

**Fix:** Share your exact `userAgent` string, I'll add it to detection

**Example iPhone 16 Plus User Agent:**
```
Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 18_0 like Mac OS X) 
AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) 
Version/18.0 Mobile/15E148 Safari/604.1
```

---

### Scenario 2: No Logs Appear

**Console shows:** Nothing or just Firebase logs

**Root Cause:** Old deployment or JavaScript not loaded

**Fix:**
```
1. Check Vercel deployment status
2. Verify commit hash matches
3. Hard refresh: Cmd+Shift+R (on Mac Safari to iPhone)
4. Clear Safari cache on iPhone
5. Close and reopen Safari
```

---

### Scenario 3: Logs Show Mobile but No Camera

**Console shows:**
```javascript
‚úÖ Mobile device detected
Is Mobile Device: true
=== CAMERA PERMISSION REQUEST START ===
Error: Camera API not available
```

**Root Cause:** Browser camera API issue

**Fix:**
```
1. Try different browser (Chrome on iPhone)
2. Check iOS version (needs iOS 11+)
3. Update iOS if old version
4. Check Safari experimental features
```
