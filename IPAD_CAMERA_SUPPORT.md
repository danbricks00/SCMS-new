# iPad & Tablet Camera Support

## 🎯 Issue Resolved

iPads and tablets were incorrectly classified as desktop devices, preventing camera access for QR scanning.

## 🔍 The Problem

iPads often report as "Mac" in their user agent string, especially when:
- Using Safari in desktop mode
- Running iPadOS 13+ (shows as "Macintosh")
- User has "Request Desktop Website" enabled

**Example iPad User Agent:**
```
Mozilla/5.0 (Macintosh; Intel Mac OS X 10_15_7) 
AppleWebKit/605.1.15 (KHTML, like Gecko) 
Version/17.0 Safari/605.1.15
```

This looks like a Mac, but it's actually an iPad with a camera!

## ✅ Solution Implemented

### Enhanced Device Detection:

```javascript
// Detects iPad even when disguised as Mac
const isIPad = /iPad/i.test(userAgent) || 
               (navigator.platform === 'MacIntel' && 
                navigator.maxTouchPoints > 1);
```

**Key Detection Points:**
1. **Direct iPad detection**: Checks for "iPad" in user agent
2. **Touchscreen detection**: MacIntel + touch = iPad in desktop mode
3. **Tablet detection**: Generic tablet patterns
4. **Mobile devices**: iPhone, Android, etc.

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Detection Logic:

```javascript
const isMobileDevice = () => {
  const userAgent = navigator.userAgent;
  
  // Standard mobile detection
  const mobileRegex = /Android|webOS|iPhone|iPad|iPod|BlackBerry|IEMobile|Opera Mini/i;
  
  // iPad in desktop mode detection
  const isIPad = /iPad/i.test(userAgent) || 
                 (navigator.platform === 'MacIntel' && 
                  navigator.maxTouchPoints > 1);
  
  // Tablet detection
  const isTablet = /Tablet|iPad/i.test(userAgent);
  
  return mobileRegex.test(userAgent) || isIPad || isTablet;
};
```

### Why `maxTouchPoints > 1`?

- **Desktop Mac**: `maxTouchPoints = 0` (no touchscreen)
- **iPad**: `maxTouchPoints = 5` (multi-touch display)
- **iPhone**: `maxTouchPoints = 5`
- **Android**: `maxTouchPoints = 5` or `10`

This is the **most reliable** way to detect iPad in desktop mode!
