  isMobile: ...,         ← COPY THIS (true/false)
  isDesktop: ...         ← COPY THIS (true/false)
}
```

## 📋 What to Share

**Copy and paste these 3 things:**

**1. The userAgent string:**
```
Example: "Mozilla/5.0 (iPhone; CPU iPhone OS 18_0..."
Your value: ???
```

**2. The isMobile value:**
```
Should be: true
Your value: ???
```

**3. The isDesktop value:**
```
Should be: false
Your value: ???
```

## 🎯 Quick Diagnosis

### If `isMobile: true` and `isDesktop: false`
✅ **Detection is working!**
→ Issue is with camera API
→ Try different browser (Chrome on iPhone)
→ Check camera permissions in Settings

### If `isMobile: false` and `isDesktop: true`
❌ **Detection is broken**
→ Share your userAgent string
→ I'll add specific pattern for iPhone 16 Plus
→ 5-minute fix!
